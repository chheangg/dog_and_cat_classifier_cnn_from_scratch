    "While planning this book, I often found myself wondering what my Linear Algebra and ODE professor, Lin Bong-Soon, would have said in his lectures. My goal was to emulate how other works achieve a tone of profound rigor in their acknowledgements—often through opening with a saying from a great physicist (or mathematician)—so this work could supposedly stand alongside other well-crafted ML/AI resources. Professor Lin and I both know that Evan rarely attended class, which makes this entire endeavor somewhat ironic.\n",

    "Fret not, I made the effort to look through my old emails and found this gem from him:\n",
    ">\"If you do decide to pick something that matters to you, then focus on mastery, instead of achievement. Mastery is current, future-proof, and demonstrable; achievement is past-tense and soon irrelevant. (I refer to personal achievement—not, for instance, an achievement that saved the world.) I'm not saying achievement isn't great; mastery is simply better.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat it resonates greatly with what I am trying to achieve. Instead of just building a simple ML/AI project by using a pretrained model from YouTube and then calling it a day, I want to actually master the basics of ML/AI through a Herculean task—by building a super-duper complex ML model from scratch to be able to tell if that image you took was of a cat, a dog, or neither (a problem worth challenging!).\n",

    "Anyways you innocent reader, if you have made this far, then I will reveal what are used in this project. This project is built as a learning exercise, the following explanation, analysis and theoretical foundations are based upon these incredible resources:\n",

    "- **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow** by Aurélien Géron. This book was instrumental for practical implementation and deployment guidance.\n",
    "- **Deep Learning Research Papers:**\n",
