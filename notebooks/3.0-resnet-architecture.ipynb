    "Deep Learning models are made up of multiple sequential layers of other model, usually composed of the models we made in earlier notebooks. The addition of newer layers allow for more representation of complex features, allowing more information to be learned resulting in an even lower loss [[1]](#ref1).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a limit to the number of layers we can effectively add. In practice, when we reach tens of layers, the model faces a **Degradation Problem** that result in stagnant accuracy, accompanied by higher training errors [[1]](#ref). \n",
    "\n",
    "He et al. proposed that the layers themselves could not fit or approximate to the **identity function**, which is the function that simply return input itself [[1]](#ref).\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we could somehow skip layers we deem useless or that it would just result in overfitting, then theoretically, we could improve our model, where adding additional layers would not worsen its performance.\n",
